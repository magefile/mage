## About

Mage is a make/rake-like build tool using Go.  You write plain-old go functions,
and Mage automatically uses them as Makefile-like runnable targets.


## Installation

Mage has no dependencies outside the Go standard library, and builds with Go 1.7
and above (possibly even lower versions, but they're not regularly tested). 

Install mage by running 

```
go get -u -d github.com/magefile/mage
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/magefile/mage
go run bootstrap.go
```

This will download the code into your GOPATH, and then run the bootstrap script
to build mage with version infomation embedded in it.  A normal `go get`
(without -d) will build the binary correctly, but no version info will be
embedded.  If you've done this, no worries, just go to
$GOPATH/src/github.com/magefile/mage and run `mage install` or `go run
bootstrap.go` and a new binary will be created with the correct version
information.

The mage binary will be created in your $GOPATH/bin directory.

You may also install a binary release from our
[releases](https://github.com/magefile/mage/releases) page.

## Plugins

There are no plugins.  You don't need plugins.  It's just Go code.  You can
import whatever libraries you want.  Every library in the go ecosystem is a mage
plugin.  Every tool you use with Go can be used with Magefiles.

## Usage
```
mage [options] [target]

Commands:
  -clean   	clean out old generated binaries from CACHE_DIR
  -init     create a starting template if no mage files exist
  -l        list mage targets in this directory
  -h        show this help
  -version  show version info for the mage binary

Options:
  -h     show description of a target
  -f     force recreation of compiled magefile
  -keep  keep intermediate mage files around after running
  -t     timeout in duration parsable format (e.g. 5m30s)
  -v     show verbose output when running mage targets
  -compile <string> 	
         path to which to output a static binary
```

## Environment Variables

You may set MAGE_VERBOSE=1 to always enable verbose logging in your magefiles,
without having to remember to pass -v every time.

## Why?

Makefiles are hard to read and hard to write.  Mostly because makefiles are essentially fancy bash
scripts with significant white space and additional make-related syntax.

Mage lets you have multiple magefiles, name your magefiles whatever you want, and they're easy to
customize for multiple operating systems.  Mage has no dependencies (aside from go) and runs just
fine on all major operating systems, whereas make generally uses bash which is not well supported on
Windows.  Go is superior to bash for any non-trivial task involving branching, looping, anything
that's not just straight line execution of commands.  And if your project is written in Go, why
introduce another language as idiosyncratic as bash?  Why not use the language your contributors are
already comfortable with?

## Compiling a static binary

If your tasks are not related to compiling Go code, it can be useful to compile a binary which has
the mage execution runtime and the tasks compiled in such that it can be run on another machine
without requiring installation of dependencies. To do so, pass the output path to the compile flag.
like this:

```
$ mage -compile ./static-output
```
