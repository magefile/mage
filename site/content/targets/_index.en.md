A target is any exported function that has an optional first argument of context.Context, has either
no return or just an error return, and where the arguments are all of type string, int, bool, or
time.Duration.

e.g. these are all acceptable targets

```
func Build()
func Install(ctx context.Context) error
func Run(what string) error
func Exec(ctx context.Context, name string, count int, debug bool, timeout time.Duration) error
func Greet(name string, loud mg.BoolFlag, count mg.IntFlag, debug mg.BoolFlag, every mg.DurationFlag)
```

A target is effectively a subcommand of mage while running mage in
this directory.  i.e. you can run a target by running `mage <target>`

## Arguments

Arguments aside from context are taken from the CLI arguments after the target name.
Strings are passed as-is, ints are converted with strconv.Atoi, bools are converted with
strconv.ParseBool, and time.Durations are converted with time.ParseDuration.

Thus you could call Exec above by running

`mage exec somename 5 true 100ms`

All arguments are mandatory and must be specified in the order they appear in the function.

You can intersperse multiple targets with arguments as you'd expect:

`mage run foo.exe exec somename 5 true 100ms`

## Flags

Flags are taken from the CLI arguments after the target name. They are
converted into usable function parameters the same as other arguments. The name
of the flag is the name of the parameter.

Thus you could call Greet above by running:

```
mage greet Adam --loud
mage greet Adam --count=3 --loud
mage greet --every 5m --count=5 adam
```

All flags are optional and may be specified in any order. They can be combined
with standard arguments and multiple targets as you'd expect.

Available flag types are:

```
mg.StringFlag
mg.IntFlag
mg.BoolFlag
mg.DurationFlag
mg.StringSliceFlag
```

Each one, expect `mg.StringSliceFlag`, only allows a single usage, with the
value of the last usage being the one that is used.

The `mg.StringSliceFlag` allows the flag to be used multiple times.

## Help/Usage Text

If a help flag (-h, --help) is added after the target, usage information will
be displayed.

```plain
$ mage say --help
Usage:
  mage say [options]  <animal>

Options:
  -h, --help    show this help
  --loud        provide the loud argument (Bool)
  --msgs        provide the msgs argument (StringSlice)

```


## Errors

If the function has an error return, errors returned from the function will
print to stdout and cause the magefile to exit with an exit code of 1.  Any
functions that do not fit this pattern are not considered targets by mage.

Comments on the target function will become documentation accessible by running
`mage -l` which will list all the build targets in this directory with the first
sentence from their docs, or `mage -h <target>` which will show the full comment
from the docs on the function, and a list of aliases if specified.

A target may be designated the default target, which is run when the user runs
`mage` with no target specified. To denote the default, create a `var Default =
<targetname>`  If no default target is specified, running `mage` with no target
will print the list of targets, like `mage -l`.

## Multiple Targets

Multiple targets can be specified as args to Mage, for example `mage foo bar
baz`.  Targets will be run serially, from left to right (so in this case, foo,
then once foo is done, bar, then once bar is done, baz).  Dependencies run using
mg.Deps will still only run once per mage execution, so if each of the targets
depend on the same function, that function will only be run once for all
targets.  If any target panics or returns an error, no later targets will be run.

## Contexts and Cancellation

A default context is passed into any target with a context argument.  This
context will have a timeout if mage was run with -t, and thus will cancel the
running targets and dependencies at that time.  To pass this context to
dependencies, use mg.CtxDeps(ctx, ...) to pass the context from the target to
its dependencies (and pass the context to sub-dependencies).  Dependencies run
with mg.Deps will not get the starting context, and thus will not be cancelled
when the timeout set with -t expires.

mg.CtxDeps will pass along whatever context you give it, so if you want to
modify the original context, or pass in your own, that will work like you expect
it to.

## Aliases

Target aliases can be specified using the following notation:

```go
var Aliases = map[string]interface{} {
  "i":     Install,
  "build": Install,
  "ls":    List,
}
```

The key is an alias and the value is a function identifier.
An alias can be used interchangeably with it's target.

## Namespaces

Namespaces are a way to group related commands, much like subcommands in a
normal application.   To define a namespace in your magefile, simply define an
exported named type of type `mg.Namespace`.  Then, every method on that type which
matches the normal target signature becomes a target under that namespace.

```go
import "github.com/magefile/mage/mg"

type Build mg.Namespace

// Builds the site using hugo.
func (Build) Site() error {
  return nil
}

// Builds the pdf docs.
func (Build) Docs() {}
```

To call a namespaced target, type it as `namespace:target`. For example, the
above would be called by typing

```plain
$ mage build:site
```

Similarly, the help for the target will show how it may be called:

```plain
$ mage -l

build:docs    Builds the pdf docs.
build:site    Builds the site using hugo.
```
