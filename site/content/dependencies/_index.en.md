Mage supports a makefile-style tree of dependencies using the helper library
[mg](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/magefile/mage/mg). To declare dependencies,
pass any number of dependent functions to mg.Deps.

A dependent function may be any function that has an optional first argument of context.Context, has
either no return or just an error return, and where the other arguments are all of type string, int,
bool, or time.Duration. Unlike targets, they do not need to be exported.

e.g. these are all acceptable dependent functions:

```
func build()
func Install(ctx context.Context) error
func compile(what string) error
func Exec(ctx context.Context, name string, count int, debug bool, timeout time.Duration) error
```

The Deps function will not return until all declared dependencies have been run (and any
dependencies they have are run). Dependencies are guaranteed to run exactly once in a single
execution of mage, so if two of your dependencies both depend on the same function, it is still
guaranteed to be run only once, and both funcs that depend on it will not continue until it has been
run.

The most common way to use mg.Deps is to make it the first line in a function, so that this function won't run until all its dependencies have run.

## Arguments

If a dependent function has no arguments or just takes a context, you can pass it directly to
mg.Deps:

`mg.Deps(Install)`

Dependent functions with non-context arguments should be passed via mg.F thusly:

`mg.Deps(mg.F(compile, "server"))`

For functions that take arguments, the arguments (except context) are considered part of its
uniqueness, thus mg.F(compile, "server") and mg.F(compile, "client") are considered distinct, but if
there are two calls to mg.F(compile, "server"), then compile("server") will only be run once.

## Parallelism

If run with `mg.Deps` or `mg.CtxDeps`, dependencies are run in their own
goroutines, so they are parellelized as much as possible given the dependency
tree ordering restrictions.  If run with `mg.SerialDeps` or `mg.SerialCtxDeps`,
the dependencies are run serially, though each dependency or sub-dependency will
still only ever be run once. 

## Contexts and Cancellation

Dependencies that have a context.Context argument will be passed a context,
either a default context if passed into `mg.Deps` or `mg.SerialDeps`, or the one
passed into `mg.CtxDeps` or `mg.SerialCtxDeps`.  The default context, which is
also passed into [targets](/targets) with a context argument, will be cancelled
when and if the timeout specified on the command line is hit.

### Example Dependencies

```go
func Build() {
    mg.Deps(f, g)
    fmt.Println("Build running")
}

func f() {
    mg.Deps(h)
    fmt.Println("f running")
}

func g() {
    mg.Deps(h)
    fmt.Println("g running")
}

func h() {
    fmt.Println("h running")
}
```

Running `mage build` will produce the following output:

```plain
h running
g running
f running
Build running
```

Note that since f and g do not depend on each other, and they're running in
their own goroutines, their order is non-deterministic, other than they are
guaranteed to run after h has finished, and before Build continues.
